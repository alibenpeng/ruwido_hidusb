************************************************

This Code is a blend of V-USB and the Ruwido decoder by Guenter Bartsch.
It should run on any ATMega*8 device. See http://vusb.wikidot.com/hardware
for general information on the USB-interface. To run the unmodified code
connect your controller like this:

PD0: USB D-
PD2: USB D+
PD3: TSOP 1756 Output
PB6/7: 16MHz Crystal

The IR decoder can run with either 12 or 16 MHz, other frequencies are not
supported.

If you want to run this on a USBASP you will have to change the pin for
USB D+ in usbconfig.h and solder the TSOP output to PIND3 of the controller.
