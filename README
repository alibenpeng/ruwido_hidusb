* RUWIDO V-USB-HID Receiver by Alexander Meyer *

************************************************

This Code is a blend of V-USB and the Ruwido decoder by Guenter Bartsch.
It runs on the ATMega8 as well as the 48-328 family. You also need a
56kHz IR-receiver, e.g. the TSOP1756.

See http://vusb.wikidot.com/hardware for general information on the
USB-interface.

To run the unmodified code connect your controller like this:

PD0: USB D-
PD2: USB D+
PD3: TSOP 1756 Output
PB6/7: 12MHz or 16MHz Crystal

The IR decoder can run with either 12 or 16 MHz, other frequencies are not
supported.

If you want to run this on a USBASP you will have to change the pin for
USB D+ in usbconfig.h and solder the TSOP output to PIND3 of the controller.

TODO:

Aggregation of modifyers does not work correctly yet.
Not all Keycodes are mapped since I didn't find codes for some of the Keys
in the USB-HID spec.
